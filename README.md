# US Pollution Analysis Project

The US Pollution Data project leverages a comprehensive dataset covering air pollution measurements across the United States — consisting of over 1.4 million observations and around 28 variables that record concentrations of major pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O₃).

This dataset spans several years and states, allowing detailed spatio-temporal analysis of pollutant levels, seasonal trends, and geographic variation. The primary objective of this project is to transform this raw data into clean, analysis-ready formats (e.g., Parquet), conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights, and — where possible — apply machine learning techniques to forecast pollutant concentrations, classify air‑quality levels, or identify key factors driving pollution.

Given the public health importance of air quality, this project has the potential not only to improve our understanding of pollution trends in the U.S., but also to inform policy, raise awareness, or support predictive systems that warn populations about deteriorating air conditions.


## Project content
1. Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sogun3/uspollution)
2. [Notebook](https://github.com/YShutko/US_pollution-_analysis/blob/faefa759121f8faf6deed4847dd77c73ba352c07/notebooks/etl_eda.ipynb)

## Data
The dataset is too large to include directly. Parquet technic was used to convert data from csv and store it in dedicated repo on GitHub
