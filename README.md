# US Pollution Analysis Project

This project analyzes the US air pollution dataset from Kaggle.

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset using `scripts/download_data.py`
2. Run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.

## Data
The dataset is too large to include directly. Use the Kaggle API to fetch it.

## Project Structure
- `data/raw/`: original large dataset (gitignored)
- `data/processed/`: cleaned/sampled versions
- `scripts/`: helper scripts
- `notebooks/`: analysis notebooks
- `outputs/`: figures and models
